To bet against a currency peg is something which is highly unlikely to end well for you. In practice you are making a bet against a central bank who defends that specific peg, who will have more firing power than almost all other financial institutions. This means they are highly capable of holding a peg, however when the macro environment changes over a longer time, the central bank often loses since they are trying to twist reality of where currency valuation should be too much. This usually could take years or decades to happen. Thus by betting on a peg fail you might be on the wrong side of the trade for over 10 years plus, this means timing the trade is especially important for a currency peg fail trade. The understanding that a peg fail is a possibility is what's the essence here, not actually the trade itself, therefore I would like to explore the different causes and consequences with HongKong dollar peg fail. We have experienced this before, such as with the swiss franc flash crash in 2015..
